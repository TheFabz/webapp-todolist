This project is part of a code challenge. It was built in roughly 48 hours and it was an introduction to many new technologies.

As a starter, I used node.js along with express.js to setup the web app aspect of this program. 
Then I set up a connection with MongoDB Atlas, this was my first time working with noSQL as well. Mongo is intuitive to use. 
Although I was advised to use mongoose, I decided to skip that and work with mongoClient directly.

As for templating, I used embedded JavaScript (EBS). It was my first experience with this particular templating engine and coming
from thymeleaf and JSP I can definitely say that this is far easier to get around.

Front end is all done on html and css, I used special aid with bootstrap and flexbox as I'm not great in the front end department.

This app asks you to log in and if you do that successfully (admin/admin) you'll get to that main screen. This app's purpose is to serve
as an agenda. Allowing you to place events into a calendar, editing, deleing and filtering through dates.
